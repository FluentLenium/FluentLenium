FluentLenium helps you writing readable, reusable, reliable, and resilient UI functionnal tests for the browser.

Written in Java, It provides [fluent interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) to 
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and brings some magic to avoid common issues faced by Selenium users.

It's shipped with adapters for [JUnit](junit.org/), [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) and 
[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io), but it can also be used standalone.

It best integrates with [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/), but you can also choose to use 
the assertion framework you want.
